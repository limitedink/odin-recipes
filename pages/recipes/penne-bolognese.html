    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>500g pasta of your choice</li>
                <li>1 Med Onion</li>
                <li>1 Med Carrot</li>
                <li>2 cloves of Garlic</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp. Dried Oregano</li>
                <li>2 cans Canned Tomatoes</li>
                <li>500g. Ground Beef</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp. of Tomato Puree</li>
                <li>2 oz Red Merlot Wine</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp. Worcestershire Sauce</li>
                <li>100ml full cream milk</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>To start, you first halve the onion.</li>
                <li>With a grater, start Grating the onion and the carrot; keep your fingers back and don’t cut your finger.</li>
                <li>Now on high heat and add a Tbsp. Olive Oil to a nonstick saucepan.</li>
                <li>Once the saucepan is heating, add the grated onion and carrot into the saucepan. Using a wooden spoon, sweat off excess moisture from carrots. You want to produce a certain degree of puree that enhances a petite body and develops the bolognese sauce.</li>
                <li>Now Lightly season with salt and pepper to the grated onion and carrot combination.</li>
                <li>Add the two garlic cloves by crushing using a garlic crusher if you have one. (If you do not have a garlic crusher, use the back of your knife and place the garlic clove underneath the blade and pound on edge and dice it after into smaller pieces) and add it into the saucepan.</li>
                <li>Add in your dried Oregano.</li>
                <li>Get your frying saucepan active using the spoon; the point is not to brown the vegetables but to lightly sweat them off.</li>
                <li>Use the spoon to make a little well in the center of the frying pan and add in your minced beef and quickly get it moving in the saucepan.</li>
                <li>Once the mince has sweated off, make a well in the center of the saucepan, then add tomato puree. It will give the bolognese a little tangy, slightly acidic taste, which is recognizable with Bolognese sauce.</li>
                <li>Add in your Red Wine now; the amount to add is entirely arbitrary, and II’dalmost says to hazard a guess as to how thick you like your sauce to be, and it’s your prerogative to add in as liberally as you like!</li>
                <li>Lower the heat and reduce the Red wine to a syrup which would give your sauce more body and strengthen its flavor profile</li>
                <li>It’s time to add in your chopped tomatoes and fold them into the awesome goodness you’ve created in your saucepan.</li>
                <li>Add your Worcestershire sauce, which gives your bolognese a little heat and spice while darkening the minced meat.</li>
                <li>Let the mixture simmer for 5-6 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add your whole cream milk to give your bolognese a little more enriched flavor to give it that smooth, silky finish.</li>
            </ol>
